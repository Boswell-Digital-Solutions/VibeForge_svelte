# Known Issues

## 2026-10-02 - `verify:repo-context` fails on a clean checkout (open)

- What is wrong: `bun run verify:repo-context` fails with `README title is Install dependencies; expected VibeForge`.
- Root cause: the README title extractor reads a heading that is not the product title. Not investigated further.
- The check `local_directory_name` also fails in a fresh clone. The directory is `VibeForge_svelte` and the manifest expects `Vibeforge`. This is expected outside the owner's checkout.
- No workflow runs this check, so CI does not show the failure. The new Documentation CI runs only `check:agent-instruction-drift`, which passes.
- Scope: open. Fix the README title extraction or the manifest, then add the check to the Documentation CI.

## 2026-10-02 - Scheduled nightly E2E workflow (open)

- What: `.github/workflows/e2e-nightly.yml` runs 6 browser shards every day at 02:00 UTC, whether or not code changed.
- The owner rule is "no scheduled full runs". The CI-scope change did not touch this workflow.
- Scope: open. The owner must decide whether to remove the schedule.

## 2026-10-02 - Coverage step is advisory (open)

- `ci.yml` runs `pnpm test:coverage` with `continue-on-error: true`. A coverage failure does not fail the CI.
- Scope: open.
